# Edit Listing Confirmation Modal - Fixes Summary

## Issues Reported and Fixed

### Issue 1: Current Effective Price Showing $NaN
**Problem:** The "Current effective price" line was showing `$NaN` instead of a real calculated dollar amount.

**Root Cause:**
- The `spotPremium` and `floorPrice` values were being passed as strings from the form
- When performing arithmetic operations without parsing to numbers, JavaScript returned `NaN`
- The weight string like "1 oz" wasn't being properly parsed to extract the numeric value

**Fix Applied:**
```javascript
// Extract numeric weight from string like "1 oz"
const weightStr = data.weight || '1';
const weightMatch = weightStr.match(/[\d.]+/);
const weight = weightMatch ? parseFloat(weightMatch[0]) : 1.0;

// Parse premium and floor as numbers
const spotPremium = parseFloat(data.spotPremium) || 0;
const floorPrice = parseFloat(data.floorPrice) || 0;

// Calculate effective price: (spot * weight) + premium, respecting floor
const calculatedPrice = (currentSpotPrice * weight) + spotPremium;
effectivePrice = Math.max(calculatedPrice, floorPrice);
```

**Files Modified:**
- `static/js/modals/edit_listing_confirmation_modals.js` (lines 56-70)

---

### Issue 2: Photo Line Says "Not Included" Even When Photo Attached
**Problem:** The photo status showed "Not included" even when a listing had an existing photo.

**Root Cause:**
- The photo detection only checked for newly uploaded files (`photoFile.size > 0`)
- Didn't check if the listing already had an existing photo displayed in the preview

**Fix Applied:**
```javascript
// Check if photo is included - either new upload OR existing photo
const photoFile = formData.get('photo');
const hasNewPhoto = photoFile && photoFile.size > 0;

// Check if there's an existing photo displayed in the preview
const photoPreview = document.getElementById(`photoPreview-${listingId}`);
const hasExistingPhoto = photoPreview && photoPreview.style.display !== 'none' && photoPreview.src;

const hasPhoto = hasNewPhoto || hasExistingPhoto;
```

**Text Updated:**
- Changed "Included" → "Attached"
- Changed "Not included" → "No photo"

**Files Modified:**
- `static/js/modals/edit_listing_modal.js` (lines 512-520)
- `static/js/modals/edit_listing_confirmation_modals.js` (lines 127, 348)

### Issue 3: Item Category Details Crammed Into Single Line
**Problem:** All item details (metal, weight, year, mint, etc.) were displayed in a single "Item:" line, making them hard to read.

**Fix Applied:**
Created a dedicated "Item Details" section with individual rows for each category field:

```html
<div class="edit-summary-section">
  <h4 class="edit-summary-section-title">Item Details</h4>
  <div class="edit-summary-grid">
    <div class="edit-summary-row">
      <span class="edit-summary-label">Metal:</span>
      <span class="edit-summary-value" id="edit-confirm-metal">—</span>
    </div>
    <div class="edit-summary-row">
      <span class="edit-summary-label">Product Line:</span>
      <span class="edit-summary-value" id="edit-confirm-product-line">—</span>
    </div>
    <!-- ... and so on for each field ... -->
  </div>
</div>
```

**Category Fields Now Displayed Separately:**
- Metal
- Product Line
- Product Type
- Weight
- Year
- Mint
- Finish
- Grade
- Quantity
- Graded (Yes/No with service)
- Photo (Attached/No photo)

**Files Modified:**
- `templates/modals/edit_listing_confirmation_modals.html` (lines 20-110, 141-227)
- `static/css/modals/edit_listing_confirmation_modals.css` (lines 88-99)
- `static/js/modals/edit_listing_modal.js` (lines 523-544)
- `static/js/modals/edit_listing_confirmation_modals.js` (lines 95-128, 315-353)

### Issue 4: Current Spot Price Not Shown
**Problem:** The current spot price wasn't displayed as its own line item in the pricing details.

**Fix Applied:**
Added a "Current Spot Price" row that displays for variable pricing listings:

```html
<div class="edit-summary-row" id="edit-confirm-current-spot-row" style="display: none;">
  <span class="edit-summary-label">Current Spot Price:</span>
  <span class="edit-summary-value" id="edit-confirm-current-spot">—</span>
</div>
```

**JavaScript Updates:**
```javascript
// Show current spot price
if (currentSpotRow) currentSpotRow.style.display = '';
if (currentSpotEl && currentSpotPrice !== null) {
  currentSpotEl.textContent = `$${currentSpotPrice.toFixed(2)}/oz`;
} else if (currentSpotEl) {
  currentSpotEl.textContent = 'Loading...';
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `templates/modals/edit_listing_confirmation_modals.html` (lines 80-84, 199-203)
- `static/js/modals/edit_listing_confirmation_modals.js` (lines 47, 144-149, 374-379)

## Calculation Logic

### Effective Price Calculation:
```javascript
// 1. Extract weight from string like "1 oz"
const weightMatch = weightStr.match(/[\d.]+/);
const weight = weightMatch ? parseFloat(weightMatch[0]) : 1.0;

// 2. Parse premium and floor as numbers
const spotPremium = parseFloat(data.spotPremium) || 0;
const floorPrice = parseFloat(data.floorPrice) || 0;

// 3. Calculate: (spot × weight) + premium
const calculatedPrice = (currentSpotPrice * weight) + spotPremium;

// 4. Respect floor price (take maximum)
effectivePrice = Math.max(calculatedPrice, floorPrice);
```

### Example Calculation:
- Current Spot Price: $2,350.50/oz (Gold)
- Weight: 1 oz
- Premium Above Spot: $5.00
- Floor Price: $100.00

**Calculation:**
```
calculatedPrice = ($2,350.50 × 1) + $5.00 = $2,355.50
effectivePrice = max($2,355.50, $100.00) = $2,355.50
```

**Result:** Current Effective Price: $2,355.50 ✅
